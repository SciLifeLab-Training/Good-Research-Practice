    :fontawesome-regular-bookmark: **Description**  
    This lesson introduces the core of Good Research Practice (GRP) in Sweden, based on [Good Research Practice](https://www.vr.se/uppdrag/etik/god-forskningssed---ny-utgava.html) ('God forskningssed', VR, 2024) and the [European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity](https://allea.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/European-Code-of-Conduct-Revised-Edition-2023.pdf) (ALLEA, 2023). It’s a practical starting point for understanding the principles that make research trustworthy.
    The lesson emphasizes how responsible research practices and transparency, as promoted in Open Science, go hand in hand. Good research practices such as proper documentation, honest reporting, and ethical collaboration support reproducibility, sharing, and trust in science.
