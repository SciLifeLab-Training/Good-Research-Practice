## 2.1 Getting started: GRP in funding applications
Acquiring research funding is often the first major milestone in a PhD project. It shapes your research direction, your responsibilities, and the expectations placed on you. **Importantly, the entire funding process must follow GRP, from designing your project idea to planning how resources will be used.**

As a researcher, you are responsible for using research funding ethically, transparently, and efficiently. In practice, this means:  

- Avoiding vague, inflated, or unrealistic project plans 
- Making sure your planned work has clear scientific value
- Designing studies that minimize unnecessary risk or harm to humans, animals, or the environment
- Using time, materials, and resources responsibly

   What this means for you in practice
</h3>
  
As a beginning researcher, these are the concrete actions you need to take when preparing a funding proposal:


5. Ensure your proposal meets the funder’s formal requirements
Different funders have different expectations. For example:
Vetenskapsrådet (VR): Emphasizes scientific quality, feasibility, and ethical soundness.
Horizon Europe: Requires a detailed ethics self-assessment and compliance with EU law.
ERC: Expects high risk–high gain ideas but strong ethical justification.
👉 Always read the funder’s instructions carefully and follow their structure exactly.

    <h4>Clearly motivate why your project should be funded</h4>
      <p>Most funders expect you to justify:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What important knowledge gap you are addressing</li>
      <li>Why your approach is appropriate and feasible</li>
      <li>What scientific or societal benefits your work could generate</li>
    </ul>
👉 Avoid overly ambitious promises! funders value realistic, well-planned projects.

    <h4>Identify ethical issues early (before you apply)</h4>
    <p>You must show you have thought through:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Possible ethical risks or dilemmas</li>
      <li>Who or what may be affected (humans, animals, communities, environment)</li>
      <li>Whether your project requires ethical approvals (e.g., animal ethics, GDPR compliance, biobank permits)</li>
    </ul>
👉 If your project needs approvals, say so explicitly. Funders want to know you’re aware of the requirements.

    <h4>Explain how you will manage ethical and legal requirements</h4>
    <p>In the proposal, funders expect you to describe:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>How you will prevent or minimize harm</li>
       <li>How data will be handled responsibly (GDPR, consent, anonymization, security)</li>
       <li>How materials will be sourced ethically (e.g., biological samples, genetic resources, fieldwork)</li>
       <li>How you will manage potential conflicts of interest</li>
    </ul>
👉 This shows that you can carry out the research responsibly, not just think about it.

    <h4>Demonstrate efficient and responsible use of resources</h4>
    <p>Funders look for evidence that you understand:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>How long tasks realistically take</li>
       <li>What materials or datasets you need</li>
       <li>What equipment, facilities, or expertise must be accessed</li>
       <li>Why these resources are necessary (and not wasteful)</li>
    </ul>
👉 This is part of GRP: well-planned research avoids unnecessary use of time and money.

When applying for grants—such as those from the [the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet)](https://www.vr.se), [Horizon Europe](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en), and [the ERC](https://erc.europa.eu/apply-grant), you must reflect on ethical aspects from the very beginning of your project. Grant applications require you to address both legal requirements and broader ethical concerns, including:  


  
For guidance on integrating ethical considerations into your grant proposals, refer to resources such as: [VR 'Conducting ethical research'](https://www.vr.se/english/applying-for-funding/requirements-terms-and-conditions/conducting-ethical-research.html), [Horizon Europe 'Ethics self-assessment guide'](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/how-to-complete-your-ethics-self-assessment_en.pdf), and [ERC 'Ethics guidance'](https://erc.europa.eu/manage-your-project/ethics-guidance). 



### **Ethical Considerations in Grant Applications**  


### **Why This Matters** 
By addressing ethical issues transparently and comprehensively in your funding applications, you help foster trust, accountability, and responsible resource use in research. Ethical integrity in grant proposals not only strengthens your application but also reinforces the credibility of scientific work as a whole.
