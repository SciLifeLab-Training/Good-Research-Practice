## 2.1 Getting started: GRP in funding applications
Acquiring research funding is often the first major milestone in a PhD project. It shapes your research direction, your responsibilities, and the expectations placed on you. **Importantly, the entire funding process must follow GRP, from designing your project idea to planning how resources will be used.**

As a researcher, you are responsible for using research funding ethically, transparently, and efficiently. In practice, this means:  

- Avoiding vague, inflated, or unrealistic project plans 
- Making sure your planned work has clear scientific value
- Designing studies that minimize unnecessary risk or harm to humans, animals, or the environment
- Using time, materials, and resources responsibly

   What this means for you in practice
</h3>
  
As a beginning researcher, these are the concrete actions you need to take when preparing a funding proposal:


<div class="action-steps">

<div class="action-step">
  <div class="step-icon">1</div>
  <div class="step-content">
    <h4>Clearly motivate why your project should be funded</h4>
      <p>From a GRP perspective, this means  defining and describing clearly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What important knowledge gap you are addressing</li>
      <li>Why your approach is appropriate and feasible</li>
      <li>What scientific or societal benefits your work could generate</li>
    </ul>
👉 Responsible research avoids exaggerated claims and ensures that the project can be carried out with integrity.

<div class="action-step">
  <div class="step-icon">2</div>
  <div class="step-content">
    <h4>Identify ethical and societal implications early</h4>
    <p>GRP requires that you actively reflect on the broader consequences of your work. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Considering possible ethical risks or dilemmas</li>
      <li>Reflecting on who or what may be affected (participants, animals, ecosystems, communities, data subjects)</li>
      <li>Understanding legal and institutional requirements (e.g., animal ethics review, GDPR, biosafety, biobank permits)</li>
    </ul>
👉 Anticipating ethical issues early ensures your project is designed to do good and avoid harm from the outset.
  </div>
</div>
<div class="action-step">
  <div class="step-icon">3</div>
  <div class="step-content">
    <h4>Explain how you will manage ethical and legal requirements</h4>
    <p>GRP involves integrating ethical and legal considerations directly into your research workflow. This means describing:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>How you will prevent or minimize harm to humans, animals, or the environment</li>
       <li>How you will ensure responsible data handling (e.g., consent, privacy, storage, access, anonymization)</li>
       <li>How materials, samples, or biological resources will be obtained and used responsibly</li>
       <li>How you will manage potential conflicts of interest and maintain transparency</li>
    </ul>
👉 This demonstrates that your research practices uphold integrity throughout the entire project lifecycle.

<div class="action-step">
  <div class="step-icon">4</div>
  <div class="step-content">
    <h4>Demonstrate efficient and responsible use of resources</h4>
    <p>GRP requires that you use time, money, data, and materials in a way that is efficient and avoids unnecessary waste. This involves showing:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>That your timeline is realistic and based on a clear understanding of the work involved</li>
       <li>That the materials, datasets, and facilities you plan to use are appropriate and justified</li>
       <li>That your project design promotes efficient use of public or institutional resources</li>
       <li>That you avoid duplication or redundant work when existing resources or knowledge can be used</li>
    </ul>
👉 This is part of GRP: well-planned research avoids unnecessary use of time and money.

## 2.2 Understanding different funders' expectations
While GRP principles are universal, each funder has its own specific emphasis. Your proposal must follow the structure, format, and requirements of the funding body you apply to. To help you integrate GRP into your funding proposal, consult the following guidance documents:

<img src="../../assets/images/VRlogo.svg" alt="law" style="width:140px; vertical-align:middle;"> [VR 'Conducting ethical research'](https://www.vr.se/english/applying-for-funding/requirements-terms-and-conditions/conducting-ethical-research.html)

<img src="../../assets/images/EUlogo.svg" alt="law" style="width:140px; vertical-align:middle;"> [Horizon Europe 'Ethics self-assessment guide'](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/common/guidance/how-to-complete-your-ethics-self-assessment_en.pdf)

<img src="../../assets/images/ERClogo.png" alt="law" style="width:140px; vertical-align:middle;"> [ERC 'Ethics guidance'](https://erc.europa.eu/manage-your-project/ethics-guidance)
  
Always read the funder’s instructions carefully and follow their structure exactly! Failing to meet formal requirements can weaken an otherwise strong proposal.
