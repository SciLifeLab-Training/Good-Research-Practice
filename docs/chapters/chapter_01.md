## 1.1 Definition
As a researcher, you are responsible for conducting your work with integrity, ensuring that your methods and findings are ethical, reliable, and credible.

Good Research Practice (GRP) forms the **ethical backbone of high-quality research**. The Swedish Research Council [(VR, 2024)](https://www.vr.se/uppdrag/etik/god-forskningssed---ny-utgava.html) defines GRP as:

> “The collective ethical criteria on how good research should be conducted.”  

In practice this means that GRP includes a set of ethical standards and professional responsibilities that guide every part of your research project, from how your experiments and designed and conducted, to data management, to how you communicate your results, and build collaborations. 

**Simply put, producing trustworthy, high-quality research is impossible without a strong commitment to GRP [(VR, 2024)](https://www.vr.se/uppdrag/etik/god-forskningssed---ny-utgava.html).**

<h3>

   The law
</h3>

In Sweden, following GRP is not just an ethical obligation, it is a legal requirement. As a researcher, you **must** comply with national and international legislation, including:  

!!! note ""

    ### Laws
    - [Law 2019:504 — Responsibility for Good Research Practice](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/lag-2019504-om-ansvar-for-god-forskningssed-och_sfs-2019-504/)

    ### Guidelines
    - [Good Research Practice ('God Forskningssed')](https://www.vr.se/uppdrag/etik/god-forskningssed---ny-utgava.html)
    - [European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity](https://allea.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/European-Code-of-Conduct-Revised-Edition-2023.pdf)

    ### Broader Ethics
    - [Declaration of Helsinki](https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-helsinki/)
    - [Nagoya Protocol](https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/default.shtml)


Beyond these formal legislations, your institution may also have its own code of conduct that you're expected to adhere to, such as the [SciLifeLab Code of Conduct](https://www.scilifelab.se/code-of-conduct/).

   What this means for you in practice
</h3>

Upholding GRP is about actively engaging with ethical principles in every aspect of your research. This means:

- Being aware of and following all relevant regulations that apply to your field.
- Maintaining good research habits and making ethical decisions at every stage of your work.
- Exercising sound professional judgment and resisting undue influence.
- Continuously updating your knowledge to keep pace with evolving ethical and legal standards.

> **Tip:** Think of GRP as your “ethical toolbox” for research decisions.

  <img src="/docs/assets/images/icon_law.png" alt="law" style="width:30px; height:30px; vertical-align:middle;">
   The law
</h3>
In Sweden, the law requires that your research-performing organization **guarantees** you academic freedom, which also means that a big part of the responsibility to uphold GRP lies directly on you, see: 

!!! note ""
 
    - [Law 1992:1434. The higher education act ('Högskolelag')](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/hogskolelag-19921434_sfs-1992-1434/)
    - [Section 4 of Law 2019:504](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/lag-2019504-om-ansvar-for-god-forskningssed-och_sfs-2019-504/)

   What this means for you in practice
</h3>
While you are expected to conduct your research with integrity, you are not alone in ensuring compliance with GRP. Your institution plays a crucial role in maintaining an ethical and transparent research environment by ([SUHF, 2023](https://suhf.se/app/uploads/2023/09/REK-2020-3-REV-Vagledning-for-larosatens-arbete-med-att-forebygga-hantera-och-folja-upp-misstankar-om-avvikelser-fran-god-forskningssed-REVIDERAD-2023.pdf)): 

- Providing **training and mentorship** to help you navigate GRP principles.
- Offering **support structures**, such as clear ethical guidelines.
- Ensuring **infrastructure and technical support** is in place, including well-defined procedures.
- Creating **incentives** that reward adherence to GRP.
