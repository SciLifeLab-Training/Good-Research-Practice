## 1.1 Definition
Good Research Practice (GRP) is the **ethical backbone of high-quality research**. It ensures that research is reliable, credible, and ethically sound [(VR, 2024)](https://www.vr.se/uppdrag/etik/god-forskningssed---ny-utgava.html).  

> **GRP = “The collective ethical criteria on how good research should be conducted.”**  

This module introduces GRP, its legal and ethical basis in Sweden, and how it shapes research behavior and institutional responsibility.

## 1.2 Legal & Ethical Foundations
In Sweden, following GRP is not just an ethical obligation, it is a legal requirement. As a researcher, you **must** comply with national legislation, including:

    ### Laws
    - [Law 2019:504 — Responsibility for Good Research Practice](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/lag-2019504-om-ansvar-for-god-forskningssed-och_sfs-2019-504/)

    ### Guidelines
    - [Good Research Practice ('God Forskningssed')](https://www.vr.se/uppdrag/etik/god-forskningssed---ny-utgava.html)
    - [European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity](https://allea.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/European-Code-of-Conduct-Revised-Edition-2023.pdf)

    ### Broader Ethics
    - [Declaration of Helsinki](https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-helsinki/)
    - [Nagoya Protocol](https://www.cbd.int/abs/text/default.shtml)


Your institution may have its own code of conduct, such as the [SciLifeLab Code of Conduct](https://www.scilifelab.se/code-of-conduct/).

## 1.3 GRP in Action
Upholding GRP is not just about avoiding misconduct—it is about actively engaging with ethical principles in every aspect of your research. This means:

- Being aware of and following all relevant regulations that apply to your field.
- Maintaining good research habits and making ethical decisions at every stage of your work.
- Exercising sound professional judgment and resisting undue influence.
- Continuously updating your knowledge to keep pace with evolving ethical and legal standards.

> **Tip:** Think of GRP as your “ethical toolbox” for research decisions.

## 1.3 Institutional Support

You are not solely responsible for maintaining GRP standards in your research project. Research-performing organizations play a crucial role in fostering an ethical research environment by ([SUHF, 2023](https://suhf.se/app/uploads/2023/09/REK-2020-3-REV-Vagledning-for-larosatens-arbete-med-att-forebygga-hantera-och-folja-upp-misstankar-om-avvikelser-fran-god-forskningssed-REVIDERAD-2023.pdf)): 

-	Providing training and mentorship to help you navigate GRP principles.
- Offering support structures, such as clear ethical guidelines.
- Ensuring infrastructure and technical support is in place, including well-defined procedures.
- Creating incentives that reward adherence to GRP. 

At the same time, Swedish law ([Law 1992:1434. The higher education act ('Högskolelag')](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/hogskolelag-19921434_sfs-1992-1434/)) dictates that your research performing organization has to guarantee you academic freedom. This freedom also means that part of the responsibility to uphold research integrity lies on you ([Section 4 of Law 2019:504](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/lag-2019504-om-ansvar-for-god-forskningssed-och_sfs-2019-504/)). Ethical considerations and legal requirements may vary across disciplines, so it is your duty to stay informed and apply GRP principles appropriately within your field.


##  What you need to succeed 

To practice GRP effectively as a researcher, develop:

- A strong understanding of GRP principles and frameworks.
- The ability to apply ethical guidelines in real-world research scenarios.
- Good professional judgment and research habits.
- The ability to resist pressures that could compromise integrity.
- The skills to navigate ethical dilemmas with confidence.

## Quick Reflection

!!! question "Reflection"
    - How do GRP principles affect your current or future research?  
    - Which legal or ethical frameworks are most relevant to your field?
