It\u2019s a practical starting point for understanding the principles that make research trustworthy. The lesson emphasizes how responsible research practices and transparency, as promoted in Open Science, go hand in hand. GRPs such as proper documentation, honest reporting, and ethical collaboration support reproducibility, sharing, and trust in science.</p> <p></p> <p> Prerequisites To follow this course, learners should have knowledge of: \u20031.
